    <p>What distinguishes a great school from a good school? I believe that clarity of purpose, exceptional teachers, and demonstrated outcomes are hallmarks of great schools. <br>A great school is a place with a deep commitment to student learning, where faculty nourish the intellectual, moral, emotional, and social growth of every student. It is a <br>place where students, teachers, and parents embark together on an academic journey with clear and well-defined objectives. It is filled with the joy of discovery and the<br> excitement of personal challenge and growth. It is a community dedicated to developing strength of character and excellence in all dimensions of its students' lives. And<br> it is a place that has a distinctive and lasting impact.<br>
    <br>      The Lotus School strives to be a great school. Our mission, simply put, is to prepare students for lives of purpose, achievement, and generosity of spirit. I encourage you<br> to explore our website to learn more about all that The Potomac School has to offer. I also invite you to visit us in person; please contact our Admission Office to schedule<br> your campus tour. We hope to see you soon!<br>
    <br>
    
    All the best.</p>
